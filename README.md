This is a simple USFM viewer implemented with Python and gtksourceview.

Use it to look at USFM files and see the syntactical elements
highlighted.

# Installing on Ubuntu

I developed this in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I had to do the following to
get pyusfmview to function:

    sudo apt install python-gtksourceview2
    sudo apt install libgtksourceview2.0-doc
    sudo apt install gnome-extra-icons
    (Not sure, but you might have to do pip install pygtk also.)

Then, take the usfm language definition file and copy it to 
wherever your gtksourceview-2.0 language-specs are located. 
For example:

    sudo cp usfm.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/

Then gtksourceview can find the language definition.

# Installing on msys2 (64-bit)

This is a partial list of things to do:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python2-pip
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pygtk

However, the above fails.

# Usage

A simple example is provided in this repository:

    ./pyusfmview.py eph.usfm

And a more complicated example:

    ./pyusfmview.py rev.usfm
